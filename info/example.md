**Example:**

```python
probability(2, 6, 3) == 0.0556  # 2 six-sided dice have a 5.56% chance of totalling 3
probability(2, 6, 4) == 0.0833
probability(2, 6, 7) == 0.1667
probability(2, 3, 5) == 0.2222  # 2 three-sided dice have a 22.22% chance of totalling 5
probability(2, 3, 7) == 0       # The maximum you can roll on 2 three-sided dice is 6
probability(3, 6, 7) == 0.0694
probability(10, 10, 50) == 0.0375
